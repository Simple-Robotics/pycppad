**PyCppAD** is an open source framework which provides bindings for the CppAD Automatic Differentiation([CppAD](https://coin-or.github.io/CppAD/doc/cppad.htm)) C++ library in Python.
**PyCppAD** also includes support for the CppADCodeGen ([CppADCodeGen](https://github.com/joaoleal/CppADCodeGen)), C++ library, which exploits CppAD functionality to perform code generation.
